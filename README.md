### How to Play

1. **Bidding Interface**: On the game screen, you'll find two dice displays. Your selected bid is shown on the left, and the generated dice result is on the right.

2. **Place Your Bid**: Use the two text boxes provided. In the first one, select the number you think the dice will roll (1 to 6). In the second text box, enter the number of coins you want to bid. Don't worry; we've implemented robust input validation to prevent invalid values.

3. **Start the Game**: When you're ready, hit the big green "Start Game" button.
